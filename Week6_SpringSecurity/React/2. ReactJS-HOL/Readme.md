# StudentApp - React Component Overview

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

This repository, **StudentApp**, serves as a foundational introduction to working with React components. It focuses on understanding the structure, behavior, and roles of components within a React application, forming the basis for building scalable, modular web applications.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- **Explain React Components**  
  Understand components as reusable, self-contained building blocks in React that define how a user interface should appear and behave.

- **Differentiate Components vs. JavaScript Functions**  
  Explore how React components encapsulate rendering logic and UI, while JavaScript functions are typically used for computation or logic without rendering views.

- **Identify Types of Components**  
  Learn about:
  - **Class Components**: Older syntax using ES6 classes.
  - **Function Components**: Modern, concise syntax using functions and hooks.

- **Explain Class Components**  
  Discover how class-based components include lifecycle methods and a render method to define UI output.

- **Explain Function Components**  
  Explore stateless components that use hooks (like `useState` and `useEffect`) for state and side effects.

- **Define Component Constructor**  
  Understand the constructorâ€™s role in initializing state and binding methods in class components.

- **Define render() Function**  
  Learn how the `render()` method in class components returns JSX to describe the UI.
