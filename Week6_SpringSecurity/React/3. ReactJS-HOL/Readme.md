# ScoreCalculatorApp - React Function Components Overview

## üìò Overview

This repository, **ScoreCalculatorApp**, introduces the use of **function components** in React to perform basic operations ‚Äî specifically, calculating and displaying the average score of a student. It also covers how to apply custom styles using external CSS files to enhance the appearance of React components.

## üéØ Objectives

- **Explain React Components**  
  Understand the concept of components as independent, reusable UI elements in React applications.

- **Differentiate Components vs. JavaScript Functions**  
  Explore how components in React return JSX and manage UI rendering, unlike standard JavaScript functions which are used primarily for logic and computation.

- **Identify Types of Components**  
  Learn the distinction between:
  - **Class Components**
  - **Function Components**

- **Explain Class Component**  
  Understand how class-based components use lifecycle methods and the `render()` function for output.

- **Explain Function Component**  
  Learn how modern React applications are built using functional components enhanced by React Hooks.

- **Define Component Constructor**  
  Understand the role of constructors in initializing state in class components.

- **Define render() Function**  
  Explore how the `render()` method outputs JSX in class components, whereas function components return JSX directly.
